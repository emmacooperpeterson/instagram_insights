    """
    Get a list of users who have mentioned the running user in their stories at
    some point after `start_time`.

    This method is inefficient and imprecise. I am not aware of a way to
    explicity grab a list of users who have shared a given post, or even a list
    of users who have mentioned the running user in their stories.

    As a workaround, this function grabs all direct message threads (up to
    `thread_limit`), and filters to the following in this order:
        - DMs from users in `usernames` (typically a list of followers)
        - DMs after the start_time (typically the time of the giveaway post)
        - DMs mentioning the running user
            - These messages have `reel_share` info, with type "mention",
              and the `mentioned_user_id` is the running user

    Note: This requires that users mention your account. Post shares without a
    mention will not be captured. This may capture mentions that are not
    associated with a share (e.g. a user mentions you in their story in some
    unrelated context).

    Parameters
    ----------
    client : instagrapi.Client
    usernames : list of usernames for which DMs should be checked
    start_time : datetime, DMs before this point will not be checked
    thread_limit : maximum number of DM threads to pull
